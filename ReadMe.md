### Stock Widget Design System
	Author: Bhaskar Mishra

## Requirement 

Build a stock picker widget which when loaded will show a search bar, user can type in the symbol of  the stock. As the user input the symbol we should show an auto-complete to list all the stocks which  qualify the search term. If the user clicks on any of the search items it should show all the details of the  stock. If the user clicks enter or search button without autocomplete selection it should show the stock  details if the symbol exists else show stock not found message.

## Prerequisite
The Stock Broker Exchange System is a robust and scalable platform designed to facilitate the buying and selling of financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and other securities. The primary goal of the system is to provide a high-performance, reliable, and secure trading environment for investors, brokers, and other market participants.

## System Architecture:

The system will be built as a distributed, microservices-based architecture to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and scalability. The core components of the architecture include:

a. Frontend: A user-friendly web-based interface for investors and brokers to access their accounts, place orders, view market data, and monitor their portfolio.

b. Backend Services: A set of microservices responsible for different functionalities such as order management, trade execution, account management, market data processing, and authentication.

c. Database: A reliable and scalable database system to store user accounts, trading data, order history, and market information.

d. Message Queue: An asynchronous message queue to handle real-time order matching, notifications, and event-driven communication between components.

e. Authentication and Security: A robust authentication system using secure protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0) to protect user data and sensitive transactions.

f. Market Data Providers: Integration with external market data providers to fetch real-time and historical market data.

## Key Features:


a. Order Types: The system should support various order types, including market orders, limit orders, stop-loss orders, and trailing stop orders.

b. Real-time Market Data: Real-time market data should be accessible to users to make informed decisions.

c. Order Matching Engine: A high-performance order matching engine to efficiently match buy and sell orders based on price-time priority.

d. Transaction Processing: Efficient transaction processing to ensure prompt execution of trades and minimize latency.

e. Portfolio Management: Investors should be able to view their portfolio holdings, gains, and losses.

f. Risk Management: Implement risk management measures to prevent erroneous or malicious activities, such as circuit breakers and order throttling.

g. Reporting and Analytics: Generate comprehensive reports and analytics for users to analyze their trading activities and make informed decisions.

h. Regulatory Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant financial regulations and reporting requirements.

## Technologies:


a. Programming Languages: Java for backend services, JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend development.

b. Web Frameworks: Spring Boot for backend, React/Angular/Vue.js for frontend.

c. Database: PostgreSQL or other suitable relational database for data storage.

d. Message Queue: Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for event-driven communication.

e. Authentication: OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication and authorization.

f. Market Data: Integration with third-party market data providers through APIs.

g. Containerization: Docker for packaging and deploying microservices.

h. Load Balancing and Scaling: Kubernetes for managing containerized services.


## Performance Considerations:


a. Scalability: The system should be designed to scale horizontally to handle increasing user and transaction loads.

b. Latency: Minimize processing latency to ensure quick order execution.

c. Throughput: Optimize the order matching engine to handle a high number of concurrent orders.

d. Reliability: Implement fault-tolerant measures to ensure continuous operation and data integrity.

## Security Considerations

a. Data Encryption: Sensitive data, such as user credentials and financial information, should be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

b. API Security: Implement robust API security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

c. DDoS Protection: Implement Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection to mitigate potential attacks.

d. Audit Trail: Maintain an audit trail to track all user activities and transactions for accountability and compliance.

e. DOM elements needs to be properly sanitized.
